# ChickenWars

## About
ChickenWars is the oldest project I have in my projects directory, meaning its evidence of my earliest coding endeavors. It is a Spigot plugin that adds a custom minigame to a server. Players are disguised as chickens and have various chicken-themed attacks. A lot of it is heavily inspired from Mineplex, and their minigame called Super Smash Mobs.

## Purpose
This was originally made to try to recreate the chicken kit from Super Smash Mobs, but I then turned it into more of a minigame. 

## Notice
This project does not work at all. It is very old, and also abandoned now.
