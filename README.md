# ChickenWars

## About

ChickenWars is the oldest project I have in my projects directory, meaning its evidence of my earliest coding endeavors.
It is a Spigot plugin that adds a custom minigame to a server. Players are disguised as chickens and have various
chicken-themed attacks. A lot of it is heavily inspired from Mineplex, and their minigame called Super Smash Mobs.

## Purpose

This was originally made to try to recreate the chicken kit from Super Smash Mobs, but I then turned it into more of a
minigame.

## Notice

This project does not work at all. It is very old, and also abandoned now.
